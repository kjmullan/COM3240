- **Conceptualisation:** Eleni Vasilaki.

## Overview
In this coursework, you will be tasked with implementing and comparing the Sarsa and Q-Learning algorithms within a "lava" gridworld environment. This repository contains all the necessary starter files and resources.

## Files Included
- `gridworld_env.py`: Implements the "lava" gridworld environment.
- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions for visualisation.
- `Assignment_empty.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook template for you to implement your solutions.

## Getting Started
To get started with this assignment:
1. Use the provided link to access the repository.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-URL>`.
3. Ensure you have Python installed, and consider setting up a virtual environment for this project.
4. Install the required dependencies.
5. Open `Assignment_empty.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook environment to begin working on the assignment.

## Assignment Tasks
Complete the navigation tasks as outlined in `Assignment_empty.ipynb`, applying both the Sarsa and Q-Learning algorithms. Your implementation should be submitted according to the submission guidelines provided in your course materials.
